I started drawing and leaving my post-it portraits in random places when I was travelling, (in the middle of magazines, inside pull-down trays on planes and trains, on counters and benches) and I eventually started to frame them and sell them as art pieces, the post it notes themselves are 5"x3" and they're in 7"x9" frames.",
